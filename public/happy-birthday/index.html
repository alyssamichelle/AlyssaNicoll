        Thank you for being there, wrapping a warm blanket around me (fresh out of the dryer) when I was chilled with fever as a child. Thank you for sitting patiently with me at the dinner table, helping me late into the night with my homework. Thank you for seeing when I was overwhelmed, and stepping in; always knowing the right balance between letting me handle life and lending a helping hand.
      </p>

      <p class='mainContent'>

        Thank you for teaching me of Jesus and his love for me &mdash; for teaching me to listen to what he thinks of me, and not the world. Thank you for your compassionate heart, that never stops amazing me. You truly do bleed for those around you, that are hurting
        or in need.

      <p class='mainContent'>

        Thank you for your whimsy, your attitude, your strength &mdash; without which, my world would not be the same. Thank you for teaching me how to work hard, how to preserver. It is because of you, that I am the woman I am today.
